							<p class="major">I am a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> with a passion for <strong>extracting useful and meaningful insights from data.</strong> 
								I am always working to expand my skillset and find the best way to solve <strong>interesting and complex 
								data problems.</strong> Those passions have served me for the past few years working as a consulting engineer 
								in the municipal water and wastewater industry, where I regularly familiarized myself with new software 
								and engineering practices to <strong>drive projects</strong> that protect public health and the environment. Today, I 
								continue to apply my love of learning in both my personal and professional life to be a better 
								<strong>teammate</strong>, <strong>athlete</strong>, <strong>musician</strong>, and <strong>friend</strong>.</p>

							<h2>NHL Player Salary Prediction</h2>
							<p>This project was designed to empower NHL executives with a data-driven approach to roster building and financial planning.
								A regression model designed to predict the average annual value of an NHL player's contract was trained on 10 years of player 
								stats and salary data scraped from CapFriendly, Moneypuck, and Hockey-Reference. The model was deployed as an in-progress
								web app using Streamlit and Render.

							<h2>Subreddit Classification with Pushshift API and NLP</h2>
							<p>Using Reddit's Pushshift API, approximately 200,000 total reddit submissions were collected from the r/hockey and r/hockeyplayers subreddits. 
								The text submissions were cleaned and pre-processed using natural langauge processing before being fed through a stack of seven 
								different classification models. The final modeling stack classified user submissions into the appropriate subreddit with 95% accuracy,
								serving as a proof-of-concept for the use of NLP as a tool for drafting text for highly targeted marketing campaigns.

							<h2>Quantifying Impact of EV Charging Stations on Air Quality</h2>
							<p>The goal of this project was to evaluate the air quality impact of recent efforts to improve electric 
								vehicle infrastructure through the expansion of available charging stations throughout the United States. 
								Time-series modeling was used to forecast air quality levels, and a regression model was used to predict
								the number of charging stations required to meet a given air quality target.
